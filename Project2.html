    <h3>Oxford and Kin</h3>
    <p>
        One brand that I work with is Oxford & Kin Eyewear. It is an upcoming local brand that sells opticals and sunglasses. I have done multiple photoshoots for them and continue to work closely with the brand.

        The most recent shoot I did for Oxford&Kin was for South Asian Fashion week with 5 male models, as requested by the eyewear owner. I typically only work with one model, however this was my first time doing a group shoot, which was intimidating. Not only were we on a time crunch, but when you have to shoot 5 people in a group it does take longer because I have to look back at the photos to see if everyone was posed perfectly. As well, you are directly 5 people at once and want everyone to look cohesive.

        What helped me prepare for this photoshoot and make it less intimidating was to create a mood board. I do this for a lot of my photoshoot to help myself and the talent to get on the same page for what aesthetic we will be going for once we start shooting. Here is an example of the mood board I created for this photoshoot.

        Of course, mood boards are just an inspiration so I did not copy the poses or the editing style. Here are some of the final images from this shoot.
