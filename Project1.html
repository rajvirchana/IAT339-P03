    <h3>The Self Portrait</h3>
    <p>
        Self portraits are not something I usually do. And as a portrait photographer, I sometimes have spurts of ideas that I would like to do a photoshoot for. However, I donâ€™t always have a model ready and available when needed, which is why I taught myself to be comfortable taking self portraits.

        A concept usually comes to mind when I see one element that inspires me and that I would want to incorporate into a photoshoot. I saw these Christmas lights that project onto a house while shopping and they had many different settings. Right then I knew I wanted to use those lights in a shoot, one way or another. The lights had different settings and colours. I choose the pink and blue combination as it gave out the a more dreamy feeling.

        I needed a dark room to shoot in. As I do not have a studio, I improvised and used my bedroom. I closed my blinds, set the light on my bed on a stack of books, and put my camera on a tripod, using a 50mm lens. The set up can be seen in figure ___.

        As a photographer, I can easily instruct a model on how to pose. However, as no one was with me, I had to take a few shots and then look through them. I would look at how I was posing, and then readjust myself. This process took a lot longer as I did not have anyone to instruct me.

        After taking a few self portraits, I have to give models a lot more credit because taking a self portrait was a lot more difficult that I anticipated.
